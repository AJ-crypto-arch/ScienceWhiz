    <h1 style="text-align:center;" class = "words">Momentum</h1>
    <p >Linear/Translational momentum is the product of the mass and velocity of an object, and is often represented by the equation $$p = mv.$$ Impulse is defined as the 
        <em>change</em> in momentum, and is often denoted by &#916;p or I. The equations of them are $$&#916;p = mv_f - mv_i = m(v_f-v_i)$$ and $$I = Ft.$$

    Often, you would see this as a composition of the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> axes, and so we must use cos() and sin() to find the lengths of the momentum vectors. As seen below,
    it can be used for elastic and non-elastic collisions(Non-elastic is where the 2 objects colliding stick together to form a single object, while non-elastic collisions allow
    the objects to bounce of eachother, making velocity and direction change.)
