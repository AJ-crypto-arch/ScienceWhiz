    <title>Kinematics</title>
    <p>Kinematics is a subfield of physics, developed in classical mechanics, that describes the motion of points, boides(objects) without considering the forces that cause them to move. Included with this a several equations that accurately describe motion as long as acceleration is constant.</p>
    <p>There are 5 main equations to use when trying to use kinematics to describe the motion of objects. Below are the full forms of the 5 kinematic equations, as well as their variable forms:</p>
    <p> 1. Total displacement = (Average velocity over the trip (final velocity - initial velocity)) * time expired OR \trianglex = vt <br> 2. final velocity = initial velocity + (acceleration of object * time expired) OR Vf = Vi + at <br> 3. (average velocity = initial velocity + final velocity)/2 OR V(avg) = (Vf + Vi)/2 <br> 4. total displacement = (initial velocity * time elapsed) + 0.5(acceleration of object)(time elapsed squared) OR \trianglex = Vot + 1/2(a)(t)^2 <br> 5. 2(acceleration of object)(total displacement) = (final velocity squared) - (initial velocity squared) OR 2a\trianglex = (Vf)^2 - (Vi)^2 </p>
    <p> When given 3 variable throughout any of the 5 equations, through substitution, we are able to calculate any of the unknown variables. </p>
    <p> For example, if we are given initial velocity, final velocity, and accelration, we are able to find time through Equation 2. </p>
